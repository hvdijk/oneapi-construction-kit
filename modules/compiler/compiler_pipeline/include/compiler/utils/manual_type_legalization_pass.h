/// On targets that do not natively support \c half, promote operations on \c
/// half to \c float instead.
///
/// When LLVM encounters floating point operations in a type it does not support
/// natively, it extends its operands to an extended precision floating point
/// type, performs the operation in that extended type, and rounds the result
/// back to the original type. However, when it extends its operands to an
/// extended precision floating point type, if an operand itself was a floating
/// point operation that was also so extended, its rounding and re-extension are
/// skipped. This causes issues for code that relies on exact rounding of
/// intermediate results, which we avoid by manually doing this promition
/// ourselves.
///
/// Simply performing operations in a wider floating point type and rounding
/// back to the narrow floating point type is not, in general, correct, due to
/// double rounding. For addition, subtraction, and multiplications, \c float
/// provides enough additional precision that double rounding is known not to be
/// an issue. For other operations, this pass may generate incorrect results,
/// but this should only happen in cases where letting the operation pass
/// through to LLVM would result in the same incorrect results.

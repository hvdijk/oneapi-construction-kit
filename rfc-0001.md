# What is an RFC?

RFC stands for Request For Comments. An RFC is a design document providing
information to the oneAPI Construction Kit community, or describing a new
feature for oneAPI Construction Kit or its processes or environment. The RFC
should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale
for the feature.

We intend RFCs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new features,
for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design
decisions that have gone into oneAPI Construction Kit. The RFC author is
responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting
dissenting opinions.

Because the RFCs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their
revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal. This
historical record is available by the normal git commands for retrieving older
revisions, and can also be browsed [on GitHub][ock].

This process is based on that of the [Python Enhancement Proposals][peps] and
differences between the two are intended to be minimal.

# RFC Audience

The typical primary audience for RFCs are the core developers of the oneAPI
Construction Kit.

However, other parts of the oneAPI Construction Kit community may also choose to
use the process to document expected API conventions and to manage complex
design coordination problems that require collaboration across multiple
projects.

# RFC Workflow

## Start with an idea for oneAPI Construction Kit

The RFC process begins with a new idea for oneAPI Construction Kit. It is highly
recommended that a single RFC contain a single key proposal or new idea; the
more focused the RFC, the more successful it is likely to be. Most enhancements
and bug fixes do not need an RFC and can be submitted directly to the
[oneAPI Construction Kit issue tracker][ock-issues]. The editors reserve the
right to reject RFCs if they appear too unfocused or too broad. If in doubt,
split your RFC into several well-focused ones.

Each RFC must have a champion -- someone who writes the RFC using the style and
format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and
attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The RFC champion (a.k.a.
author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is RFC-able. Posting
to the [Ideas category][ock-discussions-ideas] of [oneAPI Construction Kit
Discussions][ock-discussions] is usually the best way to go about this, unless a
more specialized venue is appropriate.

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing an RFC is meant to save
the potential author time. Asking the community first if an idea is original
helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be
rejected based on prior discussions. It also helps to make sure the idea is
applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea
sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most
areas where oneAPI Construction Kit can be used.

Once the champion has asked the oneAPI Construction Kit community as to whether
an idea has any chance of acceptance, a draft RFC should be presented. This
gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft RFC to make properly formatted,
of high quality, and to address initial concerns about the proposal.

## Submitting an RFC

Following the above initial discussion, the workflow varies based on whether any
of the RFC's co-authors are core developers. If one or more of the RFC's
co-authors are core developers, they are responsible for following the process
outlined below. Otherwise (i.e. none of the co-authors are core developers),
then the RFC author(s) will need to find a sponsor for the RFC.

The sponsor's job is to provide guidance to the RFC author to help them through
the logistics of the RFC process (somewhat acting like a mentor). Being a
sponsor does **not** disqualify that person from becoming a co-author or
RFC-Delegate later on (but not both). The sponsor of an RFC is recorded in
the "sponsor:" field of the header.

Once the sponsor or the core developer(s) co-authoring the RFC deem the RFC
ready for submission, the proposal should be submitted as a draft RFC via a
[GitHub pull request][ock-pulls]. The draft must be written in RFC style as
described below, else it will fail review immediately (although minor errors may
be corrected by the editors).

The standard RFC workflow is:

- You, the RFC author, fork the [oneAPI Construction Kit repository][ock-rfcs],
  check out the `rfcs` branch, and create a file named `rfc-{NNNN}.md` that
  contains your new RFC. `{NNNN}` should be the next available RFC number not
  used by a published or in-PR RFC.

- In the "rfc:" header field, enter the RFC number that matches your
  filename as your draft RFC number.

- Push this to your GitHub fork and submit a pull request.

- The RFC editors review your PR for structure, formatting, and other errors.
  For a formatted RFC, [rfc-0002] is provided as a template. Approval
  criteria are:

  - It is sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense. The editors
    do not consider whether they seem likely to be accepted.
  - The title accurately describes the content.
  - The RFC's language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.) and code
    style (examples should match [oneAPI Construction Kit's `clang-format`
    settings][ock-clang-format]) should be correct and conformant. The RFC text
    will be checked for correct Markdown formatting when the pull request is
    submitted. RFCs with invalid markup will not be approved.

    Editors should generally be quite lenient about this initial review,
    expecting that problems will be corrected by the reviewing process.
    **Note:** Approval of the RFC is no guarantee that there are no embarrassing
    mistakes! Correctness is the responsibility of authors and reviewers, not
    the editors.

    If the RFC isn't ready for approval, an editor will send it back to the
    author for revision, with specific instructions.

- Once approved, they will assign your RFC a number.

Once the review process is complete, and the RFC editors approve it (note that
this is *not* the same as accepting your RFC!), they will squash commit your
pull request onto [`rfcs`][ock-rfcs].

The RFC editors will not unreasonably deny publication of an RFC. Reasons for
denying RFC status include duplication of effort, being technically unsound, or
not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility.

Even developers should submit RFCs via pull request. When doing so, you are
generally expected to handle the process yourself; if you need assistance from
RFC editors, mention this in your pull request.

Getting an RFC number assigned early can be useful for ease of reference,
especially when multiple draft RFCs are being considered at the same time.

## Discussing an RFC

As soon as an RFC number has been assigned and the draft RFC is committed to the
[`rfcs` branch][ock-rfcs], a discussion thread for the RFC should be created to
provide a central place to discuss and review its contents, and the RFC should
be updated so that the `discussions-to` header links to it.

The RFC authors (or sponsor, if applicable) may select any reasonable venue for
the discussion, so long as the the following criteria are met:

- The forum is appropriate to the RFC's topic.
- The thread is publicly available on the web so that all interested parties can
  participate.
- The discussion is subject to the [oneAPI Construction Kit Code of
    Conduct][ock-coc].
- A direct link to the current discussion thread is provided in the RFC under
  the `discussions-to` header.

The [RFCs category][ock-discussions-rfcs] of [oneAPI Construction Kit
Discussions][ock-discussions] is the preferred choice for most RFCs.

If an RFC undergoes a significant re-write or other major, substantive changes
to its proposed specification, a new thread should typically be created in the
chosen venue to solicit additional feedback. If this occurs, the
`discussions-to` link must be updated and a new `post-history` entry added
pointing to this new thread.

RFC authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on an RFC before
submitting it for review. However, to avoid long-winded and open-ended
discussions, strategies such as soliciting private or more narrowly-tailored
feedback in the early design phase, collaborating with other community members
with expertise in the RFC's subject matter, and picking an
appropriately-specialized discussion for the RFC's topic (if applicable) should
be considered. RFC authors should use their discretion here.

Once the RFC is assigned a number and committed to the `rfcs` branch,
substantive issues should generally be discussed on the canonical public thread,
as opposed to private channels, GitHub pull request reviews or unrelated venues.
This ensures everyone can follow and contribute, avoids fragmenting the
discussion, and makes sure it is fully considered as part of the RFC review
process. Comments, support, concerns and other feedback on this designated
thread are a critical part of what the oneAPI Construction Kit core developers
will consider when reviewing the RFC.

## RFC Review & Resolution

Once the authors have completed an RFC, they may request a review for style and
consistency from the RFC editors.

The final authority for RFC approval is the oneAPI Construction Kit core
developers.

For a RFC to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a
clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must
represent a net improvement. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be
solid and must not complicate the project unduly. Finally, a proposed
enhancement must be in line with the project norms in order to be accepted.
(This is intentionally imprecise.)

Once an RFC has been accepted, the reference implementation must be completed.
When the reference implementation is complete and incorporated into the main
source code repository, the status will be changed to `final`.

A RFC can also be `rejected`. Perhaps after all is said and done it was not a
good idea. It is still important to have a record of this fact. The `withdrawn`
status is similar - it means that the RFC author themself has decided that the
RFC is actually a bad idea, or has accepted that a competing proposal is a
better alternative.

When a RFC is accepted, rejected or withdrawn, the RFC should be updated
accordingly.

## RFC Maintenance

In general, RFCs are no longer substantially modified after they have reached
the accepted, final, rejected or superseded state. Once resolution is reached,
an RFC is considered a historical document rather than a living specification.
Formal documentation of the expected behavior should be maintained elsewhere.

Active RFCs may be updated over time to reflect changes to development practices
and other details. The precise process followed in these cases will depend on
the nature and purpose of the RFC in question.

Occasionally, a deferred or even a withdrawn RFC may be resurrected with major
updates, but it is often better to just propose a new one.

# What belongs in a successful RFC?

Each RFC should have the following parts/sections:

1.  Preamble -- headers containing meta-data about the RFC, including the RFC
    number, a short descriptive title, the names, and optionally the contact
    info for each author, etc.

2.  Abstract -- a short (\~200 word) description of the technical issue being
    addressed.

3.  Motivation -- The motivation is critical for RFCs that want to change the
    oneAPI Construction Kit. It should clearly explain why the status quo is
    inadequate to address the problem that the RFC solves. This can include
    collecting documented support for the RFC from important projects in the
    oneAPI ecosystem. RFC submissions without sufficient motivation may be
    rejected.

4.  Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing why
    particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs
    that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in
    other implementations.

    The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and
    discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

5.  Specification -- The technical specification should describe the semantics
    of any new function. The specification should be detailed enough to allow
    competing, interoperable implementations.

6.  Backwards Compatibility -- All RFCs that introduce backwards
    incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities
    and their severity. The RFC must explain how the author proposes to deal
    with these incompatibilities. RFC submissions without a sufficient backwards
    compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

7.  Security Implications -- If there are security concerns in relation to the
    RFC, those concerns should be explicitly written out to make sure reviewers
    of the RFC are aware of them.

8.  Reference Implementation -- The reference implementation must be completed
    before any RFC is given status "final", but it need not be completed before
    the RFC is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching
    consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the
    principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it
    comes to resolving many discussions of details.

    The final implementation must include test code and documentation if
    appropriate for the nature of the RFC.

9.  Rejected Ideas -- Throughout the discussion of an RFC, various ideas may be
    proposed which are not accepted. Those rejected ideas should be recorded
    along with the reasoning as to why they were rejected. This both helps
    record the thought process behind the final version of the RFC as well as
    preventing people from bringing up the same rejected idea again in
    subsequent discussions.

    In a way this section can be thought of as a breakout section of the
    Rationale section that is focused specifically on why certain ideas were not
    ultimately pursued.

10. Open Issues -- While an RFC is in draft, ideas can come up which warrant
    further discussion. Those ideas should be recorded so people know that they
    are being thought about but do not have a concrete resolution. This helps
    make sure all issues required for the RFC to be ready for consideration are
    complete and reduces people duplicating prior discussion.

11. Footnotes -- A collection of footnotes cited in the RFC, and a place to list
    non-inline hyperlink targets.

13. Copyright/license -- Each new RFC must be placed under a dual license of
    public domain and [CC0-1.0-Universal] (see this RFC for an example).

# RFC Formats and Templates

RFCs are UTF-8 encoded text files using the [Markdown] format. Markdown allows
for rich markup that is still quite easy to read, but also results in
good-looking and functional HTML. [rfc-0002] contains an RFC template.

The RFC text files are automatically converted to HTML (via a [Jekyll]-based
build system) for easier [online reading][rfcs] - although this will require
running the `publish_docs.yml` workflow (Deploy Jekyll with GitHub Pages
dependencies preinstalled), either as part of a schedule or workflow_dispatch.

# RFC Preamble

Each RFC must begin with a header preamble. The headers must appear in the
following order. Headers marked with "*" are optional and are described below.
All other headers are required.

``` text
rfc: <rfc number>
title: <rfc title>
author: <list of authors' names and optionally, email addresses>
* sponsor: <name of sponsor>
discussions-to: <URL of current canonical discussion thread>
status: <draft | active | accepted | rejected | withdrawn>
```

The `author` header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses of
all the authors/owners of the RFC. The format of the `author` header values must
be:

``` text
Random J. User <random@example.com>
```

if the email address is included, and just:

``` text
Random J. User
```

if the address is not given. Most RFC authors use their real name, but if you
prefer a different name and use it consistently in discussions related to the
RFC, feel free to use it here.

If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line.

The `sponsor` field records which developer (core, or otherwise approved) is
sponsoring the RFC. If one of the authors of the RFC is a core developer then no
sponsor is necessary and thus this field should be left out.

The `discussions-to` header provides the URL to the current canonical discussion
thread for the RFC.

# Changing Existing RFCs

Draft RFCs are freely open for discussion and proposed modification, at the
discretion of the authors, until submitted to the oneAPI Construction Kit core
developers for review and resolution. Substantive content changes should
generally be first proposed on the RFC's discussion thread listed in its
`discussions-to` header, while copyedits and corrections can be submitted as a
[GitHub issue][ock-issues] or [GitHub pull request][ock-pulls]. RFC authors can
update the RFCs themselves by using a GitHub PR to submit their changes.

When in doubt, please check first with the RFC author and/or an RFC editor.

# Transferring RFC Ownership

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of RFCs to a new
champion. In general, it is preferable to retain the original author as a
co-author of the transferred RFC, but that's really up to the original author. A
good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has
the time or interest in updating it or following through with the RFC process,
or has fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to
email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because the author doesn't agree
with the direction of the RFC. One aim of the RFC process is to try to build
consensus around a RFC, but if that's not possible, an author can always submit
a competing RFC.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a RFC, you can also do this via
pull request. Fork the [repository][ock-rfcs], make your ownership modification,
and submit a pull request. You should mention the original author in a comment
on the pull request. (If the original author's GitHub username is unknown, use
email.) If the original author doesn't respond in a timely manner, the RFC
editors will make a unilateral decision (it's not like such decisions can't be
reversed :).

# RFC Editor Responsibilities & Workflow

For each new RFC that comes in an editor does the following:

- Make sure that the RFC is either co-authored by a core developer, has a core
  developer as a sponsor, or has a sponsor specifically approved for this RFC.
- Read the RFC to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make
  technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be accepted.
- The title should accurately describe the content.
- The file name extension is correct (i.e. `.md`).
- Skim the RFC for obvious defects in language (spelling, grammar, sentence
  structure, etc.), code style (examples should match [oneAPI Construction Kit's
  `clang-format` settings][ock-clang-format]), and Markdown syntax. Editors may
  correct problems themselves, but are not required to do so.
- If a project is portrayed as benefiting from or supporting the RFC, make sure
  there is some direct indication from the project included to make the support
  clear. This is to avoid a RFC accidentally portraying a project as supporting
  a RFC when in fact the support is based on conjecture.

If the RFC isn't ready, an editor will send it back to the author for revision,
with specific instructions. If Markdown formatting is a problem, ask the
author(s) to use [rfc-0002] as a template and resubmit.

Once the RFC is ready for the repository, a RFC editor will:

- Check that the author has selected a valid RFC number or assign them a number
  if they have not (almost always just the next available number).
- Ensure all CI build and lint checks pass without errors, and there are no
  obvious issues in the rendered preview output.
- Merge the new (or updated) RFC.
- Inform the author of the next steps (open a discussion thread and update the
  RFC with it, post an announcement, etc).

Updates to existing RFC should be submitted as a [GitHub pull
request][ock-pulls].

Many RFCs are written and maintained by developers with write access to the
oneAPI Construction Kit codebase. The RFC editors monitor the RFC repository for
changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes they
see.

RFC editors don't pass judgment on RFCs. They merely do the administrative &
editorial part (which is generally a low volume task).

/// @brief Extract kernel information from a declaration string.
///
/// This method is intended for parsing built-in kernel declaration strings
/// that have been hard-coded into the driver. It must not be used to parse
/// strings originating from OpenCL API calls. For performance reasons,
/// strings are assumed to be syntactically correct, and error conditions are
/// only checked for in assert builds.
///
/// Errors may leave the KernelInfo object in an undefined state in builds
/// without assertions.
///
/// The built-in kernel declaration syntax is defined in the "Built-In Kernel
/// Declaration Syntax" section of the Core Specification.
///
/// Note: We pass a `KernelInfo` by reference here, as `KernelInfo` objects are
/// already allocated and contained inside a `ProgramInfo` object, so it makes
/// more sense to "fill it in" rather than allocate a new object and replace the
/// previous one.
///
/// @param[in] kernel_info KernelInfo to populate.
/// @param[in] decl string_view of the declaration.
/// @param[in] store_arg_metadata Whether to store additional argument
/// metadata as required by -cl-kernel-arg-info.
///
/// @return Return true if successful, false on allocation failures.
